My name is k4mcz4.

I'm really curious about world of Software Development.
Everything about it makes my eyes shine, even though I barely understand those topics :)

My journey began with Eve Online and its API, that allows player to access game market data without even starting a game.
Which is really neat, to merge passion and video games.

Second game, Albion Online, sparked my interest in the topic even more.

Game itself had interesting mechanic. All items, including dropped by monsters, where at one point crafted by another player.
Those items were fed to item pool through "Black Market NPC" trader.
Everytime when game should drop an item from a monster, it checked if it is available in this pool. If not, buy price for this item went up in that trader.

This caused opportunities to go out to flea market, buy an item and sell it for profit.

It came out that communication between server and client was unencrypted, which allowed to intercept data and parse it at your own will.
Game devs didn't had any issue, as long as it was used purely for data gathering.
This allowed me to quickly obtain huge amount of data from two sources, "Black market" and Flea market.
Giving back some fat profits :)

I'm mostly trying my luck with Python, and since recently C as well.
